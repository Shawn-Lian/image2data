This is Xuan Lian(uni:xl3144) community contribution of statistics graphics.

There was a time in another class in Columbia University, one of the assignments is to perform KNN algorithms. 
The professor asked us to draw th boundary lines on the given data, which was showed on a scatter plot.
However, as no form is provided, we can not get the details of the data.
So instead of solving it quantitatively by coding, we have to draw some ugly threshold mannuly.

Then it comes to me that as many of the scatter plots as well as other plots are drawn by ggplot, which basically have a standard outcome.
Can we develop a package to extract data from the Image like .png or .jpeg file.

So in this assignment, I created a R package, which included several functions, to extract data from standard scatter plot generated by ggplot.
I was planned to use some computer vision method to detect the axis as well as the labels.
However, the workload is much more than I thought and I just finish the part of detect label position and the point position.
You need to input 4 parameters `ymax`,`ymin`,`xmin` and `xmax` to get the data extracted from the scatter plot image.

There are still many problems with is function, firstly it only work with scatter plot but not applicable for other kinds of plot yet.
Secondly the accuracy is not 100%, meaning that I can still make progress on the point detect process.

I will continue working on this to solve the problems mentioned above.
